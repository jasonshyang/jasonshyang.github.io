## ü§î Why Software Development After a Decade in Product?
After spending over a decade in the financial services industry, I developed a deep appreciation for how technology shapes and transforms businesses. My close collaboration with engineers on building cutting-edge financial products sparked a curiosity about the "how" behind the systems that drive innovation.

### A New Challenge
I thrive on solving complex problems, and software development offers endless opportunities to create, innovate, and make an impact. Transitioning into this field allows me to combine my domain expertise with the technical skills needed to build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solutions.

### A Passion for Technology
Technology has always been at the heart of the most exciting projects I‚Äôve worked on, from designing fraud prevention strategies to developing scalable financial platforms. I‚Äôm inspired by its potential to improve lives and streamline operations, and I want to contribute by becoming a hands-on developer.

### Bridging Two Worlds
I believe my unique value lies in combining deep financial services domain knowledge with strong software development skills. This enables me to function effectively as both a product manager and software developer, guiding the entire lifecycle of a product from conception to delivery. I can rapidly develop product prototypes, ensuring they meet business, user, and regulatory requirements. Additionally, my experience allows me to design systems that are not only robust in performance but also aligned with strategic objectives, driving both technical excellence and business success.
